                <h1>Streamlining the process for farming grants</h1>
                <p>
                  Working with the Rural Payments Agency (RPA) to create a digital system where farming grants can be easily created and managed whilst simplifying the application and claims process so farmers who have very busy schedules can easily recieve grants to support their businesses.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Rural Payments Agency (RPA), sponsored by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), is responsible for processing farming grant applications in the UK. The RPA handles two key funding schemes:
                </p>
                <p>
                  Farming Equipment & Technology Fund (FETF): Grants ranging from £1,000 to £50,000 to support farmers in purchasing equipment aimed at improving productivity, managing slurry, and enhancing animal health and welfare.
                </p>
                <p>Farming Transformation Fund (FTF): Larger grants up to £500,000 for investments aimed at improving productivity, profitability, and environmental sustainability.
                </p>
                <p>The current application process is heavily manual, requiring farmers to submit applications via email, often leading to a lot of back-and-forth communication. This method is time-consuming, prone to errors, and delays, as the RPA manually verifies details across multiple systems. The goal of this project was to streamline the process by creating a more efficient, user-friendly system that enhances the overall customer experience and reduces administrative workload for the RPA.

              <h2>The Challenge</h2>
              <p>
                Our research with the RPA revealed several pain points in the current application process:
                <ul>
                  <li>Farmers frequently miss out key information when submitting their applications.</li>
                  <li>Farmers weren’t clear on where this service started and ended and felt like they had provided some of the information to the RPA previoulsy so didn’t want to be asked again.</li>
                  <li>There is a significant amount of manual data checking and re-entry required.</li>
                  <li>The application process is lengthy and inefficient, resulting in a poor user experience for farmers.</li>
                  <li>Some of the interactions on pages were confusing.</li>
                </ul>
              </p>

            <div class="container portfolio-section-title " data-aos="fade-up">
              <h2>Approach</h2>
              <p>
                We adopted a user-centered design process to address these challenges and improve both the customer experience and business processes for the RPA.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Key steps taken:</b>
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Question Protocol:</b> We examined the current application form and identified unnecessary questions. We streamlined the process by ensuring only essential information was requested.</li>
                  <li><b>Cross-Team Collaboration:</b> Worked closely with DEFRA’s farming teams to identify overlaps in services and opportunities for integration.</li>
                  <li><b>Design Exploration:</b> We used Figma to mock up various design solutions and iterated based on feedback from DEFRA’s accessibility team.</li>
                  <li><b>Prototyping:</b> Developed interactive prototypes that showcased key features like result pages, filters, and a basket tool for item selection.</li>
                  <li><b>User Testing:</b> Ensured the designs were accessible, functional, and user-friendly by testing prototypes with real users, refining them based on their feedback.</li>
                </ul>

              <h2>Research & Insights</h2>
              <p>
                Our research focused on understanding the needs of farmers, their interaction with the current system, and how we could optimize the user experience. Key insights included:
                <ul>
                  <li>Farmers often lack clear guidance during the application process, which leads to submission errors.</li>
                  <li>Farmers are time poor are have seasons in the year where they are very busy</li>
                  <li>Some users may have limited digital literacy, which could hinder their ability to engage with the new system effectively.</li>
                  <li>Some farmers felt like the pieces of equipment they are get grants for aren’t always the most useful for the business and feel like the RPA can be too prescriptive.</li>
                  <li>When farmers provide their claims evidence, they sent these to the RPA which can often include images with file sizes that are too big</li>
                  <li>	Some farmers face challenges in reusing previously uploaded documents, which complicates the claims process.</li>
                </ul>
              </p>

              <h2>Outcomes</h2>
              <p>
                The project resulted in several key improvements to the grant application process:
                <ul>
                  <li>Streamlined Data Collection: By conducting a question protocol, we were able to ensure that only necessary information was requested from farmers. We also explored integrating data from other DEFRA systems to minimize the need for repetitive data entry.</li>
                  <li>Improved Guidance: We introduced context-sensitive guidance throughout the application process, ensuring farmers had clear instructions when submitting essential information, such as photographs or other supporting documents.</li>
                  <li>File Reuse for Claims: We addressed a critical need by allowing farmers to reuse uploaded files for multiple items during the claims process. This feature also adhered to accessibility standards, ensuring that the system was easier to navigate for all users.</li>
                  <li>Interactive Prototypes: Using the GOV.UK prototyping kit, we created interactive prototypes that featured ealistic results pages, working filters and item selection from a basket, simulating the full user journey.</li>
                </ul>
              </p>

            <div class="container portfolio-section-title" data-aos="fade-up">
              <h2>Conclusion</h2>
              <p>The final designs were well-received by both the RPA and DEFRA teams. The proposed solution provides a more streamlined, intuitive process for farmers applying for grants, helping to reduce administrative overhead and errors.</p>
              <p>However, our research also revealed that some farmers, especially those with limited digital skills or who rely on analogue systems, may find the transition to a digital process challenging. This insight led us to recommend ongoing support for these users, including digital literacy initiatives and targeted assistance to ensure that no one is excluded from accessing essential funding.</p>
